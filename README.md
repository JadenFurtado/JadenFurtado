## My hacking career:
![Alt text](/istockphoto-502860430-612x612.jpg?raw=true)

I have always found hacking as an escape from stress and pressure, where I get to write the rules and others play by them. Also, it is really cute to see peoples reactions when they ask me what I do in my past time! Goes without saying, I have never used my skills to cause anyone damage or harm in anyway. I have hacked numerous websites for fun and to pass time. I have done everything from SQL injections, XSS, CSRFs to exploiting business logic errors and I have taken down quite a few corporations (I canâ€™t name any, given my NDAs with said corporations) software and websites.
