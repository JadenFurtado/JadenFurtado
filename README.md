As a developer, I have most of my work has been centred around web development. That being said, I am more than able to write code for desktop/android applications. I know PHP, Python, Java, C++, C, SQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript. I am familiar with web development frameworks of Django and Flask as well as other MVC frameworks of Laravel and Codeigniter. 

## My hacking career:

I have always found hacking as an escape from stress and pressure, where I get to write the rules and others play by them. Also, it is really cute to see peoples reactions when they ask me what I do in my past time! Goes without saying, I have never used my skills to cause anyone damage or harm in anyway. I have hacked numerous websites for fun and to pass time. I have done everything from SQL injections, XSS, CSRFs to exploiting business logic errors and I have taken down quite a few corporations (I canâ€™t name any, given my NDAs with said corporations) software and websites.
