# I am Jaden Furtado

### An engineer, developer, hacker, artist and musician. 
### I have always had a passion for coding, love for pure maths, got into hacking when I was in school, been drawing and playing the piano since I was 5. I love to test my limits and see what I am capable of.

I have always found hacking as an escape from stress and pressure, where I get to write the rules and others play by them. Also, it is really cute to see peoples reactions when they ask me what I do in my past time!
